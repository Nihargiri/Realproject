Throughout my career as a DevOps Engineer, I have utilized source control tools like Git, GitHub,
 and GitLab to manage code repositories and collaborate with development teams.
 I am proficient in performing code versioning, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts using these tools. 
I have also utilized Git hooks and Continuous Integration (CI) processes to automate code quality checks
 and identify bugs earlier in the development cycle. By integrating source control tools with CI/CD pipelines, 
I have been able to catch and fix bugs more efficiently, leading to higher code quality and faster release cycles.
 My experience in using source control tools enables me to effectively manage codebases and 
ensure code integrity throughout the development process.
